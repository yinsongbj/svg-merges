# svg-merges
I have always wanted to find a good nodejs component to merge some svg images into one image. Unfortunately, I have not found an ideal method.

I wrote a module myself to implement the above functions. The current method is to use canvas and xml parser. At present, canvas is ready to work, and xml is still looking for good components.If you know, please tell me: yin_song@msn.com

# Install
